## 1. Partnerships

After a long discussion and a round of golf. We have decided that for our earliest creators we would like to create a partnership structure. We think this will be more attractive to midsized creators 
then their current situation at other sites. If you are a creator and and interested in a partnership. Let us know at partnership@foxor.io!


## 2. Investors!?

All three cofounders love the idea of investors. Since we believe in ourselves and in our budding company we want to have as many advantages in the early game as we can get.
The main problem facing us is how to find smart investors who will help us achieve our goals. We are start our search by reaching out to conferences and 
startup labs to see if they can help or at the very least point us in the right direction. If you are an interested investor be sure to reach out invest@foxor.io.
